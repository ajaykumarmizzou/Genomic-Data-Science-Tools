# Genomics Data Science Tools

This document provides a comprehensive list of tools commonly used in genomics data science. Each tool has its own strengths and is designed to perform specific tasks in the genomics workflow.

## Sequence Alignment / Mapping

- [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa): BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome.

- [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml): Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences.

- [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR): STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) is a bioinformatics tool for the fast and accurate alignment of RNA-seq reads to a reference genome.

## Variant Calling

- [GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us): The Genome Analysis Toolkit or GATK is a software package developed at the Broad Institute to analyse high-throughput sequencing data.

- [FreeBayes](https://github.com/freebayes/freebayes): FreeBayes is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find small polymorphisms.

- [SAMtools](http://www.htslib.org/): SAMtools is a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data.

## Genome Assembly

- [SPAdes](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/): SPAdes is a genome assembly algorithm that is intended for both standard isolates and single-cell MDA bacteria assemblies.

- [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu): Canu is a fork of the Celera Assembler, designed for high-noise single-molecule sequencing.

- [ABySS](https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss): ABySS is a de novo, parallel, paired-end sequence assembler that is designed for short reads.

## Annotation

- [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka): Prokka is a software tool for the rapid annotation of prokaryotic genomes.

- [Blast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi): BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) finds regions of local similarity between sequences.

- [InterProScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/interproscan.html): InterProScan is a tool that combines different protein signature recognition methods into one resource.

## Visualization

- [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/): The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance visualization tool for interactive exploration of large, integrated genomic datasets.

- [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/): The UCSC Genome Browser is an interactive website offering access to genome sequence data from a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species and major model organisms.

- [Circos](http://circos.ca/): Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information in a circular layout.

## Workflow Management

- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Snakemake is a workflow management system that uses Python-based language for workflow definition.

- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/): Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers.

- [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/): Galaxy is an open-source platform for data-intensive biomedical research that allows users to perform computational biology tasks without the need for programming.

These tools form the backbone of many genomics data science projects, and understanding how to use them effectively can greatly enhance your productivity and the quality of your results.
